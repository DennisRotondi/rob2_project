Properly regularize machine with flexible junctions (see \small{Figure~\ref{fig:ejexample}}) is not a toy problem. As a matter of fact, the presence of elasticity at joint level is very common in industrial robots that heavily relies on motion transmission/reduction elements such as: belts, long shafts, cables, harmonic drives, or cycloidal gears Figure~\ref{fel}; aiming to relocate the actuators next to the robot base, thus improving power/dynamic efficiency. Flexible elements are also preferred for physical humanâ€“robot interaction, since they allow a decoupling between actuators and the lighter links. As always there is a trade-off: increasing the agility and safety of the robot we pay a cost in controlling it with a more complex and sophisticated law. Therefore many different approaches have been proposed \cite{simplepd,deluca93,deluca96} and in what follow we'll report our reasoning and experiments applying the learning one \cite{deluca96} adapted to our study case, underling the differences with respect to the rigid model studied during the course and giving a proof of convergence as well.
