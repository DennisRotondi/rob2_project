Notwithstanding the notorious challenge in control elastic joint robots, by this extension of the rigid case we have accomplished astonishing results for the regulation task. In practice the sufficient conditions for convergence are very easy to satisfy, and even when severely violated the desired configuration can still be reached, hinting that there could be a further refinement. Unfortunately, down to very soft joints this approach need to be rethought. Completing this project has been an educational journey through the whole pipeline of solving a control problem in robotics: starting from modelling the robot and ending up in simulating the environment for the trials. In these weeks we have been able to use many of the tools learned over the last year in Robotics 1 and Robotics 2, understanding how every single component of the control law affect the evolution of the state variables and having set strong fundamentals on which build upon for future projects.
